#Static Electricity Charging By Rubbing demostration

 
## Charging by Rubbing experiment concepts

### About the experiment
   
   The experiment shows static electricity generated by rubbing an object with the material.
    
### Static Electricity:
    When two objects are rubbed with each other, electrons may get transferred from one object to another.
     
    If an object loses some electron, this object becomes positively charged. If an object gains electrons, this object becomes negatively charged.

    The transfer of charges is responsible for static electricity in various objects.

### Examples:
    (i) When a plastic comb is rubbed with dry hair, it acquires a small charge. 
    (ii) When a plastic refill is rubbed with polythene, it acquires a small electric charge.
     (iii) When we rub a plastic scale on your dry hair, the scale can attract very small pieces of paper.
